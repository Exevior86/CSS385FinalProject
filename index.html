        <div>
            <p class="body">Our game is about a single, lonely white blood cell that must protect the body from viruses
                attempting to invade. The
                blood cell has only one weapon in it's arsenal: the all powerful antibodies! The white blood cell must
                destroy the
                viruses by shooting antibodies at them. In the body are many blood cells which the viruses are trying to
                infect. If too
                many get infected the body will be overrun. Grab power ups to help the white blood cell eliminate the
                enemies, but be
                aware that power ups only last a short amount of time while giving great power. Our game offers two
                modes: Campaign and
                Survival. In Campaign mode, expect to fight through a series of increasingly-difficult levels. In
                Survival mode, the
                battle of white blood cells and the body is endless, so see how long you can survive before being taken
                over!
                Our game aligns with the theme of exponential because the infection in our game has exponential-like
                growth and the
                aesthetics of our game are based on the idea of a virus spreading.

        <h3>Google Form Comments</h3>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* A screen-wide kill-all-enemies weapons would be a cool addition, for limited uses
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Have another way to shoot other than just clicking, like pressing space bar.
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* There are too many viruses and it is impossible to kill them all, try to have different
            weapons or triple shooter for example
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* The shooting mechanics were very smooth, and aiming was smooth too. (: but the game was kinda
            too challenging, and didn't notice what power up actually changes
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Really fun game, really excited to see how it turns out when it's finished
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Consider implementing some script that prevents additional enemies from spawning when a player
            is in a certain radius. It is too difficult to get to cells to heal if enemies are spawning on top of the
            player. The music if fun!
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Powerups should respawn? Map size makes it difficult to manage cells since they get reinfected
            very quickly. Shoot speed if fine if it's not in overwhelm. Touch to fix is not clear, for a while I thought
            it was also the shooting mechanic.
        </h5>
        <h3>Player Observation</h3>
        <h4>&emsp;General Observation</h4>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Asked if there was an objective other than surviving
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Didn’t retry after dying once
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Death was very quick since our prototype was difficult, so none of the testers played for more
            that a minute or so
        </h5>
        <h4>&emsp;Specific Observation</h4>
        <h5>&emsp;Player 1</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Took a seconds to realize that the main character was the main character
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Intuitively understood how to shoot and collect pickups
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Accidently cured a cell by running over it. Then vocalized realization of that mechanic
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;Player 3</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Asked whether there was a way to shoot other than mouse click. Said using the mouse felt
            awkward
        </h5>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <h4>&emsp;What we learned during this playtest</h4>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Some players found the game confusing</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* It seems like players didn’t understand what powerups did or were aware when the
            collected them</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* It seems like players didn’t understand that they could cure cells by touching them</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* We didn’t get encouraging responses to our google form question “Did the game feel good.”
            Players found the game unsatisfying</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* There are few sound effects or other elements of feedback that improve feel</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* One of the comments we got was that enemies can spawn on top of the player, which is
            probably very frustrating</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Players felt overwhelmed by the enemies. The viruses spawned too quickly and were too good at
            taking over the screen</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Replaying a level isn’t interesting enough.</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* No player retried the prototype once</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* Every player asked if there was more to the game</h5>
        <h4>&emsp;What we plan to do differently based on these observations</h4>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Add some particle effects or sounds to make it more clear that the player has cured cells or
            hit enemies</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* Making changes like this should make the game more intuitive and better feeling</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Weaken the viruses so that the player feels more able to control the enemies</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Add player abilities such as a screen clearing bomb to make the player more powerful compared
            to the viruses</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Add level progression.</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* We hoped that players would be interested in replaying the same level to get a better
            score, but that doesn’t seem realistic now</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Add alternate control options, such as a keyboard key to shoot</h5>
