        <h1 class="description">Description:</h1>
        <div>
            <p class="body">Our game is about a single, lonely white blood cell that must protect the body from viruses
                attempting to invade. The
                blood cell has only one weapon in it's arsenal: the all powerful antibodies! The white blood cell must
                destroy the
                viruses by shooting antibodies at them. In the body are many blood cells which the viruses are trying to
                infect. If too
                many get infected the body will be overrun. Grab power ups to help the white blood cell eliminate the
                enemies, but be
                aware that power ups only last a short amount of time while giving great power. Our game offers two
                modes: Campaign and
                Survival. In Campaign mode, expect to fight through a series of increasingly-difficult levels. In
                Survival mode, the
                battle of white blood cells and the body is endless, so see how long you can survive before being taken
                over!
                Our game aligns with the theme of exponential because the infection in our game has exponential-like
                growth and the
                aesthetics of our game are based on the idea of a virus spreading.

        <h3>Google Form Comments</h3>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* A screen-wide kill-all-enemies weapons would be a cool addition, for limited uses
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Have another way to shoot other than just clicking, like pressing space bar.
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* There are too many viruses and it is impossible to kill them all, try to have different
            weapons or triple shooter for example
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* The shooting mechanics were very smooth, and aiming was smooth too. (: but the game was kinda
            too challenging, and didn't notice what power up actually changes
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Really fun game, really excited to see how it turns out when it's finished
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Consider implementing some script that prevents additional enemies from spawning when a player
            is in a certain radius. It is too difficult to get to cells to heal if enemies are spawning on top of the
            player. The music if fun!
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Powerups should respawn? Map size makes it difficult to manage cells since they get reinfected
            very quickly. Shoot speed if fine if it's not in overwhelm. Touch to fix is not clear, for a while I thought
            it was also the shooting mechanic.
        </h5>
        <h3>Player Observation</h3>
        <h4>&emsp;General Observation</h4>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Asked if there was an objective other than surviving
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Didn’t retry after dying once
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Death was very quick since our prototype was difficult, so none of the testers played for more
            that a minute or so
        </h5>
        <h4>&emsp;Specific Observation</h4>
        <h5>&emsp;Player 1</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Took a seconds to realize that the main character was the main character
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Intuitively understood how to shoot and collect pickups
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Accidently cured a cell by running over it. Then vocalized realization of that mechanic
        </h5>
        <h5>&emsp;Player 3</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Asked whether there was a way to shoot other than mouse click. Said using the mouse felt
            awkward
        </h5>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <h4>&emsp;What we learned during this playtest</h4>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Some players found the game confusing</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* It seems like players didn’t understand what powerups did or were aware when the
            collected them</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* It seems like players didn’t understand that they could cure cells by touching them</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* We didn’t get encouraging responses to our google form question “Did the game feel good.”
            Players found the game unsatisfying</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* There are few sound effects or other elements of feedback that improve feel</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* One of the comments we got was that enemies can spawn on top of the player, which is
            probably very frustrating</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Players felt overwhelmed by the enemies. The viruses spawned too quickly and were too good at
            taking over the screen</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Replaying a level isn’t interesting enough.</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* No player retried the prototype once</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* Every player asked if there was more to the game</h5>
        <h4>&emsp;What we plan to do differently based on these observations</h4>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Add some particle effects or sounds to make it more clear that the player has cured cells or
            hit enemies</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* Making changes like this should make the game more intuitive and better feeling</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Weaken the viruses so that the player feels more able to control the enemies</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Add player abilities such as a screen clearing bomb to make the player more powerful compared
            to the viruses</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Add level progression.</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* We hoped that players would be interested in replaying the same level to get a better
            score, but that doesn’t seem realistic now</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Add alternate control options, such as a keyboard key to shoot</h5>

        <h3>Google Form Comments</h3>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* “The secondary fighter that comes after you play for a bit drifts outside the map range when
            you're at the bottom of the map. I would use some camera clamping script so it doesn't show outside the
            border. I would suggest to ramp up the enemy creation in the first level or reduce the amount of enemies
            needed to kill. It felt really slow trying to get to 150.”</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* “Honestly the game is super fun and I'm a huge fan of these types of games”</h5>
        <h3>Player Observation</h3>
        <h4>&emsp;General Observation</h4>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Many players wanted to press the home button on the mid-level screen</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* It seems like most players didn’t notice that they got the clone upgrade</h5>
        <h4>&emsp;Specific Observation</h4>
        <h5>&emsp;Playtester 1</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* DIdn’t realize he could move at first</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Asked about what happens at 150 kills (That’s how many the first level required)</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* On level1, the player was able to keep the viruses in control so they didn’t spawn quickly
            enough to be interesting</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Expected something to happen when score reached 150(time)</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Didn’t continue after the first level ended, evidently because they didn’t realize that the
            end screen allowed them to progress</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* The mid-level screen looks like the game is over</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;Playtester 2</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Asked what happens when they get an upgrade</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Took a seconds to realize that the upgrade was getting an additional character</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;Playtester 3</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Said that the first two levels could be harder</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Asked to be able to turn down shooting volume because the sound is annoying</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;Playtester 4</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* More Animations and feedback from the game</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Sound needs to be able to be adjusted and reduced overall by half or more</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Bomb needs animation -- minor</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Need a how to so players can learn how to play the game</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Death animation/fade to defeat screen so it’s not so abrupt</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Score needs to be changed from a double such as 34.565435 to something more appeasing</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Reset health and all other variables on level change</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Professor felt as if he was invincible health/damage system doesn’t have good feedback (maybe
            flash the screen when hit)</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Level 1 was too easy too many units to kill</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Level 2 was just about right</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Level 3 seemed fine</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Lots of pink… maybe need better color scheme</h5>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <h4>&emsp;What we learned during this playtest</h4>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Our game lacks feedback</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* It’s not obvious when the player loses life</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* Most players didn’t realize when they got an upgrade</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Our UI is confusing</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* Visually unintuitive</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* Players confused score with enemies destroyed</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* The end-of-level screen looks like the game is over</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Our game doesn’t communicate all mechanics well</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* Some players were confused about the controls</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* Players didn’t understand win condition at first</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* It’s not initial obvious that players can cure infected cells</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* The levels we prepared for the alpha were too easy</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* When players can destroy all viruses as soon as they spawn, The difficulty doesn’t
            increase and the game becomes boring</h5>
        <h4>&emsp;What we plan to do differently based on these observations</h4>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Add a way to adjust the sound</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Change the score to be something of more substance instead of a double with 6 significant
            digits</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Add feedback for getting hit by the virus such as a sound effect plus the screen flashing to
            indicate receiving damage</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Add a transition for when the player defeats the level or gets defeated and add a sound effect
            as well</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Add a how to screen to the intro scene to explain the controls and what to do in the game
            specifically</h5>
        <h2>Final(Beta) Playtesting Reports</h2>
        <h3>Google Form Comments</h3>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Maybe make the virus objects more aggressive in trying to attack the player, that way you
            could increase the frequency and duration of the power-ups!</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;*Looks great, love the look, feels really functional, feels pretty complete. after beating a
            level maybe move toward the next one automatically?</h5>
        <h3>Player Observation</h3>
        <h4>&emsp;General Observation</h4>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Players reacted strongly to the screenshake and flash when taking damage. Some players audibly
            reacted</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Players playing survival mode were surprised by how difficult the level got. They often
            laughed and said things like:</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* “This is nuts. The whole screen is covered”</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* “These guys are so fast”</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* “Oh, there’s actually so many of them”</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Players didn’t realize what caused a level win in campaign mode. They didn’t complain about
            it, but we know it caused confusion because the developers asked</h5>
        <h4>&emsp;Specific Observation</h4>
        <h5>&emsp;Playtester 1</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Said that the title screen looks fuzzy and hard to read</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Level 1: “Is this the only cluster I need to protect?”</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* Didn’t realize there were other cells elsewhere in the map</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Continue button didn’t resize correctly in the player’s resolution.</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Level 3: was initially confused. Took a while to figure out where the cells were</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* “Oh, I can pick up powerups. Oh cool”</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Played whole campaign</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* Never got hit once</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* Said was too easy</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* “When do you get another character?”</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* Noticed that they got another character but was curious how</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Didn’t realize you could sprint</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* “You should move difficulty settings so that they’re more obvious”</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Knew there were bombs because they’re mention on the UI, but didn’t know how to use them</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;Playtester 2</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* “Do these guys duplicate?”</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* Asking how the viruses spawn</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* “I wonder if bullets should be faster”</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* Looks weird that you can outrun bullets when you sprint</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Seems unfair when viruses spawn on top of player</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Noticed a bug where one click uses all bombs</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Asked if there was a way to see your kills during a game</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* Said that they wanted to compare with their previous run</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;Playtester 3</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Confused that both player and clones didn’t cure cells</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Forgot about bombs until one of the developers reminded him</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Satisfied when getting powerup</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Survived without taking much damage on hard mode</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Noticed a bug where sound gets louder the more clones you have</h5>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <h4>&emsp;What we learned during this playtest</h4>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Some of the levels are confusing at first. Since only a portion of the level was visible,
            players didn’t know where the cells were at first.</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Players won’t pick up on all mechanics themselves</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* Players generally didn’t know how to activate bomb or sprint</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* They also didn’t understand what causes them to win a level in campaign mode</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Campaign mode was too easy, even on hard mode</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Nobody will realize there’s a difficulty slider if it’s in the settings screen</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Players react well to having many viruses on screen and the feeling that enemies are taking
            over the level</h5>
        <h4>&emsp;What we plan to do differently based on these observations</h4>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Add an instruction screen to explain the controls and how the games works</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Make the difficulty harder on all modes</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Put the difficulty option in a place players can’t miss</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Design levels to leverage the virus spreading mechanics and force the player to deal with
            large numbers of enemies</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* Players liked survival mode, so we want to make more levels like that</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Tweak the levels to be more intuitive</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* Maybe initially place the player so that some cells start out visible</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Differentiate player and clones with different color or size</h5>
        <h4>&emsp;Recommendations for future extensions that we did not get to implement</h4>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Redesign the campaign mode to use a more meaningful objective</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* Currently, the player proceeds to the next level when they defeat a certain number of
            enemies. It seems like players found this objective unintuitive and unrewarding</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Tweak the size of the camera and level elements so that the players have a better sense of
            what is in a level as soon as they start playing</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;* Currently, players don’t know what is in a level unless they explore it</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Include a tutorial explaining how viruses spawn and infect cells</h5>
        <h5>&emsp;&emsp;* Add a UI element indicating when the player will get another clone</h5>

        <h2>Team Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            Our team communicated well. We met regularly, made all of our deadlines, updated our Trello board
            frequently, and otherwise were well organized. Everyone was willing to do their part, including meeting at
            inconvenient times and staying up late to work on CSS385. I don’t remember any arguments or significant
            friction between our members. We always collaborated to finish the game, working towards the goal of
            improving the project.<br>
        </p>
        Priorities if we had 2 more weeks:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Add a leaderboard so that players could compete with each other for high scores. We found that some
                people who play the current version want to compare scores, so this seems like a logical inclusion</li>
            <li>Add more features to levels such as walls. Walls and other features would allow us to design more
                distinct levels</li>
            <li>Different enemies such as bacteria or prions. Different enemies would add variety to the game and allow
                us to design more complex scenarios</li>
            <li>Make enemies mutate</li>
            <li>Make scenarios with specific objectives</li>
            <li>Implement a storyline with a secret twist</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
