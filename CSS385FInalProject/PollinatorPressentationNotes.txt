What is the importance of the fig wasp in the ecosystem? Do they have any predators that feed on them?

Almonds need cross pollination from trees, almond industry is growing and honeybees can't
keep up with the demand. Transporting causes mal-nutrition they use sugar syrups which weakens immune system
and keeps them active and reproduce faster. Almonds are using more pesticides more than others.
Are local honeybee populations at risk too? Or are the commercially transported and reared bees
the ones that are endangered? Do you think the awareness is more about the industry of bee
keeping and their ability to make money over conserving them and keeping them safe?

The bigger the bee the further it can forage, bees get bigger as they get older.
The bigger the wing size means they can fly further too.
Body size can be used to predict foraging distance.
